description: 'A hapless jaywalker is struck by a speeding taxicab and is rushed to
  the nearest emergency room. Taking his vital signs, the doctors notice something
  unusual: the patient has not one, but two heartbeats. This discovery kicks off a
  chain of events that culminates in the realization that humans are not alone on
  Earth. Are these interlopers friends or foes? Read Ten From Infinity to find out.'
